# Assignment7

In this assignment we were tasked with taking our Calculator Console Application, which we created for Assignment 4, and refactor it using the principles and patterns we learned, such as: 
SOLID (design principles)
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
YAGNI (You Aren't Going to Need It)
IoC (Inversion of Control)
DI (Dependency Injection)

# Requirements

1) Updated Unit Tests
2) 90% Code Coverage
3) Updated README.md
4) Submitted via GitHub

# Bonus points

1) Change the Calculator Application to allow for more than two operands to be peformed with each of the operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide). (25 points)

2) Utilize DRYIOC, UNITY, or some other third party dependency injection type extension, instead of Microsofts. (50 pts).
